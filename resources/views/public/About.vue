                Our unequal world desperately needs changes, but the power to change is limited by resources, reserved for the privileged few. We are here to level the playing field. We believe that small, personal, local changes lead to bigger shifts in society. Thatâ€™s why we want to make sure every voice has a chance to be heard, every idea has enough fuel to get off the ground.

                To remove financial barriers to the spirit of giving, we created a platform where ordinary people can raise money without actually paying money. POWERSHARE is where crowdfunding meets browser-based mining for cryptocurrency - we call this concept Fundmining and it means that simply by keeping a browser tab open, anyone can convert unused CPU power into a financial resource to fund important causes and ideas presented on the platform. Apart from this innovative technology, our platform enables direct donations of both, fiat and cryptocurrencies, via PayPal and MetaMask integrations.

                This platform represents an Alpha version of the final product and reaffirms Powershare as the first company to integrate a cashless donation option into a charity crowdfunding platform. Through integrating CoinHive API for mining Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency, backers are now able to support causes they think are important by just one click of a button, without paying a penny from their pockets. Although, we are still in a testing phase, and the amount of cash generated through this feature is negligible as mining Monero is un-profitable considering current market conditions and difficulty levels within the Monero network. Despite negligible profitability testing this feature and receiving feedback of the community are of paramount importance for upgrading the technology.

                After thorough testing, the next big milestone of Powershare development will be the launch of Beta platform which will enable donations of processing power to scientific research institutions, who, will use the donated CPU as a substitute for supercomputing.
            </p>
            <p>
                By enabling anyone with access to the internet to support scientific research and ordinary people simultaneously, we bring the most generous closer to science.
