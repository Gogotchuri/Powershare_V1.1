    "about" : {
      "description" : "Powershare is a donation-based charity crowdfunding platform where users can help chosen campaigns without actually paying money. For this, they have to become online volunteers, choosing one of all the different ways to donate for free. On this stage, we offer two ways: watching video advertisements and filling out online surveys. In the near future we will add sign ups on different websites and testing them, downloading certain applications, etc. Money paid by companies for these mini-services will be transferred to the campaigns chosen by you. \n Our goal is to give people the opportunity to change their lives and those of others for the better. We believe that fundraisers will mostly be backed by those who understand their situation. In today’s world, helping someone with money is a luxury, but as it seems, every problem is solvable. After almost two years of hard work and testing of different free donation-based charity crowdfunding models, we managed to create a test version which allows people who want to help others to actually act upon their philanthropic wishes, despite their financial situation, . \n            This is a beta version of the website and we’re actively working on improving it. \n            Here, anyone can publish any type of project, whether it is concerned with education, health, startup, environment, society etc, or help others for free. If you have any additional questions please contact us at any time, we value your advice and remarks - info@powershare.fund \n Thank you for using our platform and we wish you all the best in your future endeavours!",
